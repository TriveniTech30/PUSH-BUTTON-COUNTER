# PUSH-BUTTON-COUNTER
A push button counter is a simple project that counts how many times a button is pressed. Each press increases the count by one and displays it on a screen or monitor. It helps in learning basic Arduino input and counting logic.

## A push button counter is a simple and useful embedded systems project that demonstrates how a microcontroller can detect user input and perform counting operations. In this project, a push button is connected to an Arduino Uno board as a digital input device. When the user presses the button, the Arduino reads the signal and increases a counter value stored in its memory. Each press of the button adds one to the count, and the updated value can be displayed on the Serial Monitor, LCD display, or LEDs. This project is commonly used by beginners to understand the basics of electronics and programming because it teaches important concepts like digital input and output, variables, conditional statements, and loops. A resistor, usually 10kΩ, is connected with the push button to prevent floating signals and ensure stable readings.

One important concept learned in this project is debouncing. When a button is pressed, it does not produce a clean signal instantly; instead, it may create small rapid on-off signals due to mechanical vibrations. Debouncing techniques in software or hardware help ignore these false signals so the counter increases only once per press. This improves the accuracy of the project.

The push button counter has many real-life applications. It can be used as a people counter at entrances, a product counter in industries, a voting system, or even as a score counter in games. Through this project, students also learn how hardware and software interact in an embedded system. The hardware includes components like Arduino Uno, push button, resistor, breadboard, and jumper wires. The software part involves writing code in the Arduino IDE, uploading it to the board, and testing the system.

This project is very helpful for building a strong foundation in embedded systems and IoT. It improves problem-solving skills and logical thinking. Beginners gain confidence in circuit connections and coding. It also encourages experimentation, such as adding an LCD display, reset button, or wireless communication for advanced versions. Overall, the push button counter is a small but powerful project that clearly shows how embedded systems work in everyday devices. By completing this project, learners develop practical knowledge that can be applied to more complex systems in the future. It is an ideal starting point for anyone interested in electronics, robotics, or automation, because it combines simple hardware with easy programming while still teaching valuable engineering concepts.
